Hi there. Thank you for visiting my blog. Let me introduce about myself.

My name is Phuc Dai Huynh a.k.a Austin, and I am from Vietnam. I have been studying a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of South Australia since 2019 and recently was invited to be a PhD candidate. I had an Advanced Diploma in Game Development at NIIT Cho Lon in 2011, and a Bachelor in Software Technology at Ho Chi Minh University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology (HUFLIT) in 2012 before the Master degree. 

I started working as a Game Developer in the senior year in my Bachelor until now and worked for a few Game studios as well as Tech start-ups. Web client development was my first job in which I was responsible for making layouts in HTML and writing logic code by JS, then backend development using Django, a Python web framework. In the next 5 years, I used a few game engines and frameworks for making games such as LibGDX, Cocos2d-x, and Unity3D. Unity3D is my favourite because it has C# as the scripting language, fast to build, and easy to learn. I thought my career focus is just the client-side before a colleague told me "Don't limit yourself into such the most favourite thing. You should look around and learn new knowledge because they would support in the IT industry since it's large and you will have more potential solutions for an issue". Yes, I changed my mind. I learned how to use Ubuntu, purchased a Macbook Air to experience MacOS, asked Senior developers about databases, optimizations, and ... developer life. I swiftly find backend development compelling as I when I wanted to implement a simple PvP system using C# Socket class. It was painful at the beginning with a bunch of tutorials to read, unexplained bugs, and unprecedented behaviours, but it was gradually substituted for freaking good feeling when all work as expected. From that point, I worked more on the backend side and shortly learned about DevOps. Docker is the first thing I learned ever in DevOps tech stack. Many people asked me why I don't learn Kubernetes, but only one answer I can give them is "It is so complicating to me".  

My career had changed dramatically since 2019 when I decided to invest all of my saving money to myself with a Master degree in Data Science in a foreign country, Australia, at age 29, 7 years after graduation. In the beginning, I had no idea what is Data Science, but the funny thing is we kept talking about The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) back in Vietnam. I struggled a lot with Statistics for Data Science course in the first Semester. Mean, median, distribution, histogram, etc. tortured me in the first 6 weeks of the course. I sometimes did not believe that I can keep up this degree, and I started questioning myself "Did you make a right move?". You know what? Yes, I did not give up. I spent sleepless nights to study the foundation of statistics and mapped mathematical terms from English to Vietnamese because I studied it before in my Bachelor. My performance improved significantly, and I was from a man who looked for classmates to ask for hints to a student who could answer some simple questions from the lecturer. It leads to a volunteer job as a Data Engineer at a property valuation start-up in UniSA incubator hub in the summer vacation 2020. I was fortunate to have the invitation to be a PhD candidate in the Third Semester, a month since this post. Bioinformatics is what I will aim to research in the next 4 years, and you know what? I was really bad at biology in high school. Nevertheless, learning never ends, I was able to tackle such obstacles a year ago, so now I can do it once again with the highest level of confidence. 

That is the pretty short story about myself. Thank you for reading until the end. In the next blog posts, I would share about my programming experience, Data Science, and Bioinformatics.

Cheers!
